# WebResume
A resume project that I worked on while learning Front End Web-Design on LinkedIn Learning. 
I created this project on the 6th of October 2019; it is my first website that I have created. 
There's a navigation bar, a functioning Download PDF button, alongside a pretty swanky color scheme.
I hope you enjoy checking out my website. 
Its biggest flaw is in its lack of Responsive design and lackluster navigation, but I am very proud of my first attempt.
